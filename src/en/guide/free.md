### Step 1:
- Find the `üîêÔΩúverification` channel [direct link](https://discord.com/channels/1069057220802781265/1203687333107335198)

- Find the message sent by Micah-bot

### Step 2:
Click on `Bind free card`, follow the provide link by the bot after clicking on it, watch the ad and skip it.

### Step 3:
If the bind message shows `Success`, you have successfully finished claiming the license, if it doesn't show as `Success`, repeat from the first step.

### Step 4:
::: info If you already got a enc.json delete it before opening the program
:::
Launch the program to obtain your `HWID`, after that head to `üîêÔΩúverification` again and click on `Get verification file` and paste in your `HWID`.

After clicking on submit you will receive a file from the bot, download it and place it on your Korepi folder. Make sure the name is `enc.json`.

### Step 5:
Launch the program again and select your game path if you didn't yet, after that Korepi will launch the game and inject itself.

Enjoy Korepi!
