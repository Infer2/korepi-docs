### Step 3:

:::
Click `Get Verification File`, and you need to fill in your `HWID (device ID)` obtainable after opening the program once.
- You will get a file from the bot, download it and place it on your korepi folder. Make sure the name is `enc.json`.

You can also click `View Subscription Information` to view your subscription information.

## How to pause the key

Click on `Pause Card` and type `YES` to pause it. You can unpause it anytime and your subscription will continue.

::: info You can only pause the key once every 30 days
:::

## How to change HWID (Device ID)

Click on `ID(Change HWID)`, and paste in the new `HWID` you get from opening the program, after that download the new file and place it on your Korepi folder.

::: info You can only reset the HWID once every 7 days

## MD5 Verification Issue
Each time you obtain the `enc.json` file again, the previous `enc.json` file will become invalid.

If the new one is still invalid, please obtain the file again. If it still doesn't work, wait for a while and try again.
