### Status: No active subscription(s) found, Invalid license key

You need to [get a new key](../guide/getkey.md) from `‚Å†üîêÔΩúverification`, if you can't get a key or if the key doesn't work, you have to wait till key expiration.

`Sponsors can use F:Reset Key instead`

Open `cmd` as administrator and write the following command:

After completing the checks, restart the computer and check.

If it doesn't work, reinstall Windows.
